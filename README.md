# Ruby on Rails Code Review

This directory contains the relevant files of an application that is working
in production and free of any functional bugs.

# Instructions

Your task is to review the open PR and provide feedback as if you were a
maintainer of this project.

Review the code both from a programming/style and from an operational perspective.
Please be thorough in your review.

Provide clear feedback to the engineer about how to improve this PR. You may
provide suggested code changes as well if you'd like.

**It's important to keep in mind that:**

- the current proposed solution might not be the best and you may propose other solutions
- there might be other existing non-functional issues that can be addressed
- every change is a potential risk, the PR might be introducing a functional bug.
